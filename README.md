Flighty-Web
===========

All the source code of the site hosted at woosey.info/flighty for #sepr13 assessment 2.

__Simply FTP, SSH, or generally shoe-horn the 'flighty' folder (or its contents) onto your favourite hosting, and update .htdocs defaults to your own taste. Serve neat with a lime and stick of celery.__

## Pro-Tips

1. Every link is relative, other than the the home links (i.e. 'flighty' with the logo class).
2. There are no download files included (files folder is empty). Beware skeleton links.
3. Probably best to avoid changing any javascript unless you absolutely detest a particular part of the site. I haven't really documented it (#yolo).
4. Try the Konami code.
5. There should be nothing remotely dynamic. If there is email me at 'helpyourswebsiteissentient@markwoosey.com'.
6. You might want to change or dump the video in the carousel. It looks lovely but it takes forever to load and the music is really irritating.
7. The video probably causes the most overhead of anything.
8. Other than the fact I self hosted the files.
9. But seriously this site took up [vast amounts of bandwidth](http://imgur.com/1J7fyQU).
10. The Konami code doesn't actually do anything, but I bet you tried before reading this far.

## Disclaimer

This site is provided as-is with no guarantees. I accept no responsibility for any catastrophic data-loss, sales, late-nights, insomnia, headaches, migranes, nausea, dizziness, or other results that may arise from use of this site. It is based quite heavily on Twitter's [Bootstrap 3.0](http://getbootstrap.com) and the 'Carousel' example. Any resemblance to anyone living or dead is rather worrying as it's a website and again, this implies it has gained sentience and a humanoid form.
